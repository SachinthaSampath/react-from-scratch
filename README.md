# React
Is a framework for building user interfaces

### React is an __agnostic__ user interface library 
- doesn't care where the components are rendered
- The react code should be integrated with a second library for rendering
- A React element is not a DOM element

### Component architecture
- A Components also import `React` and can import other resources as well
- Can use functions or classes to create components, but function are by far more popular
- Rather than having to call the function, can use the component format (<Header/>)

### One way data flow
- Data flows down one way from one component to another, down to it's children

### Component
- Every component has ability to manage it's own state and can pass it down to it's children
